- datbase (sql and non sql)
# Node  
create api and connect database (with mySQL and nonSQL database) 
### express js 
its a framework of node.
> Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform.  


### what is Node js
